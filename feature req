Outfit Data Structure: Outfit and OutfitSelection still store item URIs. We might eventually want them to store WardrobeItemData (or at least id and uri) to more easily access names/subcategories of items within an outfit. This is a larger refactor for how outfits are handled.
Editing Item Details: We don't yet have a way to edit an item's name or subcategory after it's been added to the wardrobe, we can add this to our 'hold to edit' feature when its in edit mode, clicking on the item can let you edit the item name and subcategory
